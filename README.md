#UNITY #C-Sharp #Card-Game

An implementation of a card game.

As part of an hiring process for game dev job i was asked to write an implematition (Using OOP princeples and design pattrens)
to card game API i was provided.

Although i cant upload the API for an obvious reasons, i uploaded my implemetation.

I used Builder design pattren to allow loading game assets from any type of text file source (Json,Xml etc.).
Also,Consts variables (String etc.) to minimaize space complexity 
And free card assets to design the Board and cards.

enjoy (:
