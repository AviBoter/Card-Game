#UNITY #C-Sharp #Card-Game

An implementation of a card game.

As part of an hiring process for game dev job i was asked to write an implematition (Using OOP princeples and design pattrens)
to card game API i was provided.

Although i cant upload the API for a obious reasons, im uploading my implemetation.

I used builder design pattren to allow loading game assets from any type of text file source (Json,Xml etc.).
And free card assets to design the Board and cards.

enjoy (:
